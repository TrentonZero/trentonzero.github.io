  mkd_text: "Today was my first day at a new job, and so far, so good. Like a first
day anywhere, it starts off a little overwhelming. But I like the people in my
\"pod,\" and so far at least I like the work I'm doing. It's a little unsettling
doing the whole \"pair program\" thing on your first day when you really don't
know the code-base, don't know the IDE (they use IntelliJ), and half your work
is just getting your system configured. But I think it will grow on me, and I
will feel a little less like I am dragging things down as I get used to IntelliJ
and the new company's way of doing things. \n \nStepping back a moment, what the
hell is a \"pod\" (I imagine you asking)? A group of three developers and two
testers that work together on tasks, though, counter-intuitively, people regularly
pair outside their own pod. I think it just provides organizational structure.
\n\nI was placed in one of the Android pods. Even though I, personally, am an
iPhone user. On the one hand, that's cool, I get it, I can prove I know Java,
but less so Objective-C. On the other hand, kinda wished I'd been placed on the
iPhone side of the house. But you know what? It's cool. It sounds like there's
more than a little cross-pollination, and hopefully I'll have a chance to switch
sides of the house once I've proven myself. And if not, hey, I got nothing against
Google. \n\nMore later, but so far, I think I like this new joint."
