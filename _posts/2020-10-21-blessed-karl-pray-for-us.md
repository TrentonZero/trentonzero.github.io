They are there, hundreds of them, packing into a room to commemmorate a dead man they didn't know, who died five generations before their time and took with him a world they never knew and cannot imagine. 

But, they think they do, and they long for it. Poor American children living in the secular age, mourning a long dead Austrian and what he represents to them. Heaven help them.

And Heaven help us. Heaven save us from the Twitter-trad-Catholic girls, complaining that the Twitter-trad-Catholic boys who boast that they believe in wife-spanking are boring in real life. 

A naughty game is amplifying, reverberating, and morphing, and meeting in packed auditoriums to mourn the passing of the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. 

Blessed Karl, pray for us!
