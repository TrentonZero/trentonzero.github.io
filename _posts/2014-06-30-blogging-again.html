rebranded the page into a personal blog and actually started writing again, at
least a little bit.\n\n Mostly I'm doing it because I feel like I used to have
a way with words on paper, and now... now I do not. I flatter myself, I know,
whatever level of writing talent I had ten years ago is definately not present
in the my soul now, so there has been a decline, because now the whole thing feels
unnatural to me. And I'm not happy about that. I don't think I'll ever start writing
<del>short stories</del> unfinished novels again, mind you. That ship has sailed.
And that's fine because I made my choices. A man can't do everything, and my brief
stint with a paying writing career did not feel me with joy and happiness and
fulfillment, but rather made me feel like slime. \n \n I'd rather read.\n\nBut
a blog post now and again, that's different. That just helps to keep the gears
spinning. And it doesn't hurt that (this month anyway), the better half is out
almost every day for a training course. Beats the alternative.  Lately, I've just
been sitting around wondering what point life has when you are :\n\n* bored with
games\n* not at work\n* and away from your significant other.\n\nThat's how I've
been filling the evenings, Monday through Thursday, for the past few weeks, and
it doesn't work. \n\nInstead, I can fill the void with a journal. Get some good
practice in, and maybe have a good habit that will stick in the following months."
