```
A sizable 401k
Savings, a Roth,
Substantial equity in a home
Even a secret stash of gold and silver
For the unthinkable days

A decade ago 
With this money 
I’d have boarded the next flight 
For Japan, China, Europe.
I’d resign. 
And I’d laugh and be free.
Or was that always her
And did i lose my adventure 
With Inverse proportion to my power?

Why is there a law of work
And a savior that
Forbids care
