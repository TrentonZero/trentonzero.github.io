Good poetry, like wine  
best to drink and play.  
Bad poetry, like phlegm,  
best expel and toss away.

Man on the train looks  
like Alec Baldwin, actor  
Where's the camera?

I sometimes wonder  
Does alcohol help or hinger?  
Let's discover!

Hispanic woman  
with a beauty mark.  
Best have that checked.

Wouldn't Facebook be  
a better place by far  
if all the spam was replaced  
with poetry bizarre?

If you are cold, dear,  
why are you clutching  
an iced coffee?

Must I really  
spend my days in a café  
and wear a beret?

Working long hours  
Engineers earn a fortune  
to replace pad'n'pen.

Love poems and lim'ricks  
can be told in epic mode  
Just keep a straight face.
