It was over.

Finally, all my midterms had been given.

Now, all that remained was to wait an hour in my office for the official end of the weekend.

I was so happy...

It was supposed to be so great...

But, once again, I heard the chanting...

Office...

That absurd singing...

...he's in the office...

It was the goblins...again the goblins...always the fucking goblins!

Office...
...he's in the office...
Kevin Goblin Slayer
doesn't have his Goblin Bane...
he can't run now..
Let's get him!

I put my head on my desk, and covered it with my arms...I screamed...I cried..I begged for mercy from that relentless howling and, finally, chomping.

But mercy would not come.

Kevin the Goblin Slayer, son of Rex, is no more.
