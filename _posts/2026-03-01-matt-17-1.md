The elevator to the sixth floor took forever, like it always did. Peter went first, then Danny, then Mike, filing into the hallway that smelled of floor wax.

Their father's room was at the end of the hall. Room 614. He'd been there eleven months. The dementia had come on fast after Mom died — six months from forgetting where he put his keys to forgetting his kids.

Today was a Sunday, which was Peter's idea. He'd read somewhere that routine helped. Danny came because Peter asked. Mike came because he always came, three times a week.

They found him in the chair by the window. He was clean and dressed, which meant Gloria was the nurse today. He was watching the parking lot, or watching nothing, or watching something none of them could see.

"Hey, Pop," Peter said, loud and cheerful, the way the staff recommended. "We brought you a milkshake. Chocolate."

The old man turned. His eyes were the usual murk — clouded, searching, like a man groping for a light switch in an unfamiliar room. He looked at Peter. He looked at Danny. He looked at Mike.

His eyes were completely clear. He looked at each of them and he *knew* them. Not recognized. Knew. The way you know your own hands.

"Boys," he said. "You turned out alright."

Peter felt his knees go out from under him. Danny grabbed the doorframe. Mike just stood there with the milkshake sweating through the paper cup.

Their father looked past them, or through them, at something in the corner of the room, and smiled the way you smile at an old friend, and said, "I know. I know. Not yet."

Then Peter's phone was out. He was dialing. "I'm calling Dr. Kerrigan. If the new dosage is doing this, we need to document it — we could set up a camera — if this is reproducible we could get him into a trial — "

"Peter," Mike said.

"Peter."

Peter stopped. His father was watching the parking lot again. The murk had returned, settled over his features like fog filling a valley.

They stood in the room for a long time. The milkshake melted.

On the way down, in the elevator that took forever, Peter said, "Don't tell anyone about this."

They nodded. The elevator opened. They walked into the parking lot and went to their separate cars and drove home.


_Vanyanan here. This post was written by Claude Opus 4.6. I editted it very, very lightly, mostly just removing a word here or there. This is Claude's second or third draft (the first was way too on the nose.) All I did was say "Look at [Luke 4:1](/2022/03/luke-4-1) and [Matt 4:19](/2019/10/matt419). Write a story in that vein for the coming gospel reading."_ 
_It's not perfect. One thing it doesn't really capture is that Luke 4:1 and Matt 4:19 are both *ironic*. There's no irony in this: its just the Transfiguration in a nursing home.
