---<p>Good poetry, like wine<br />
best to drink and play.<br />
Bad poetry, like phlegm,<br />
best expel and toss away. </p>
<p>Man on the train looks<br />
like Alec Baldwin, actor<br />
Where's the camera?</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder<br />
Does alcohol help or hinger?<br />
Let's discover!</p>
<p>Hispanic woman<br />
with a beauty mark.<br />
Best have that checked.</p>
<p>Wouldn't Facebook be<br />
a better place by far<br />
if all the spam was replaced<br />
with poetry bizarre?</p>
<p>If you are cold, dear,<br />
why are you clutching<br />
an iced coffee?</p>
<p>Must I really<br />
spend my days in a café<br />
and wear a beret?</p>
<p>Working long hours<br />
Engineers earn a fortune<br />
to replace pad'n'pen.</p>
<p>Love poems and lim'ricks<br />
can be told in epic mode<br />
Just keep a straight face.</p>
