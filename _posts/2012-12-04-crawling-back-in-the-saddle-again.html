<p>I switched jobs back in July from a company that was, let's face it, borderline insane, to one that is actually sane. I disagree with a few details about the way they do things, but they are actually, you know, disagreements and not "What the %$#% do you mean we don't keep backups of our production servers and databases?" I'll take differences of opinion any day of the week over insanity.</p>
<p>That means I have lot more time to work on side projects, and I'm starting to feel the itch of needing a side project to work on. I mean, I haven't written a line of code for myself in a year and a half, and now that I've been back to actually working a 40-hour, 8-4/9-5, sane week, I actually feel like I have something left over to have a life and personal pursuits outside of work. I actually read blogs and books and magazines again. I visit friends. I actually, occasionally play a video game. I can pick up a book about my profession and read it at home and not feeling like I am going to retch because it reminds me of work. This the most humiliating to admit, but I feel like I can think again. And that means I'm starting to have ideas again. (Aren't those things dangerous?)</p>
<p>Also, it's become fairly obvious to me that I'm never going to "just save" enough to money to take six months to a year and bring a personal project to fruition. I'm either going to work on the side on personal projects (and enjoy it) or not, but I'm never just going to find twenty grand sitting around to cover me while I follow a dream.</p>
<p>So, here we go.</p>
