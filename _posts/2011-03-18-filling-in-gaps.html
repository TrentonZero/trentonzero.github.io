<p>I spent about an hour this morning <del datetime="2011-03-18T15:54:45+00:00">wasting time on nostalgia</del> filling in the 'miscellany' and 'old projects' portions of the site. Time I should have spent on my contest entry, making lunch, and responding to the editors over at "that place" so I can get paid.</p>
