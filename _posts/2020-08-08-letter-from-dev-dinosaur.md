## Letter from a Dev Dinosaur

Dear Hipster Coders,

<br/><br/>

If you fashionably hate OOP, 

but your fulltime job is writing OOP, 

but your "OOP" code is full of ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬-ing switch-case statements,

then you don't hate OOP,

and you aren't cool and trendy.

You're trapped in 80s

writing bad PASCAL,

and we're here for you

when you finally realize

that polymorphism wasn't invented

for your testing framework.

<br/><br/>

With Love,

The Dev-Dinosaurs
